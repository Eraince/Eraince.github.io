I received not only encouragement but also advice for improvement. I felt nervous during the first three meetings since I was worried about speaking in awkward English in front of many people. However, everyone smiled at me and, they noded often to express their agreement on my idea.  After a few meetings, I felt really safe and relaxed. That’s when I really started to make progress. Now, I really feel comfortable and confident speaking in front of people, no matter whether they are friends or strangers. I also made a lot of friends here with whom I felt a personal connection and became friends. I have to say that Toastmasters not just provides a platform for public speaking, but also a supportive and helpful community, which I feel is very important for international students like me.</p>

My first meeting was in February 2015 and I was seriously scared of public speaking. During high school and college, I had avoided any position or opportunity where I have to speak publicly. But a few days before my first Toastmasters meeting, I had heard this quote by Eleanor Roosevelt "You must do the things that you think you cannot do”. I decided I am going to speak and not care about anything. In my ice-breaker speech, I had lot of filler words and grammar mistakes and I got stuck few times. But, I found the club members to be so encouraging and supportive that I decided that I will improve. Over the last 20 months, I have completed my Competent Communicator and Competent Leadership tracks at Toastmasters. I became Treasurer in 2015 and this year took office as the President. I felt most proud when my advisor sat in my lecture and said “I am a good speaker” and asked me to share my secret with my lab-mates. Toastmasters teaches us what you cannot learn in the classroom. </p>
