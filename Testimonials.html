I received not only encouragement but also advice for improvement. I felt nervous during the first three meetings since I was worried about speaking in awkward English in front of many people. However, everyone smiled at me and, they noded often to express their agreement on my idea.  After a few meetings, I felt really safe and relaxed. Thatâ€™s when I really started to make progress. Now, I really feel comfortable and confident speaking in front of people, no matter whether they are friends or strangers. I also made a lot of friends here with whom I felt a personal connection and became friends. I have to say that Toastmasters not just provides a platform for public speaking, but also a supportive and helpful community, which I feel is very important for international students like me.</p>
