					<h2>What is this speech about ?</h2>
					<ul>

						<li>The ability to persuade people – getting them to understand, accept and act upon your ideas – is a valuable skill.</li>
						<li>Your listeners will more likely be persuaded if they perceive you as credible, if you use logic and emotion in your appeal, if you carefully structure your speech and if you appeal to their interests.</li>
